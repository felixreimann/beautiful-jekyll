My name is Felix Reimann and I am currently working as developer for Audi Electronic Ventures GmbH in the area of API design, realtime communication (esp. automotive Ethernet), development of domain specific languages, and distributed systems. Before, I was working as a researcher at Chair for Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg where I graduated as Doktor-Ingenieur. My main focus is on design space exploration for distributed embedded systems.
