All our distributed system design projects have now moved from Sourceforge to Github.
* [Opt4J](http://opt4j.org) is a framework for multi-objective optimization which allows you to do both tasks easily, either add new heuristic optimization algorithms or use state of the art optimizers for your real world problem.
* [OpenDSE](https://github.com/felixreimann/opendse) uses Opt4J for the specific problem of distributed and/or embedded systems optimization, solving the design space exploration problem.
* [JReliablity](http://jreliability.org/) is a calculator engine for reliablity measures, such as mean time to failure etc. for complex systems.

We are currently planning to create an Github organization to hold all these different efforts.
